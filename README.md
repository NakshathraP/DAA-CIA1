Prims algorithm was successfully implemented
Dijkstras algorithm is built on the fact that weights are not negative. But it works for this case because the negative weight is lesser than that of the positive ones.

Out of the other algorithms Prim's is the most useful with the least time complexity

Python was chosen to make inputs and traversal easier
